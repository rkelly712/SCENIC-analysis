# SCENIC-analysis

## Content
--------
The following code represents the use of SCENIC+ to delineate the enhancer regulatory landscape across gastrulation. 
The input data was derived from a publication in which the 10x multiome platform was used to profile the gastrulating embryo from E7.5 - E8.75.

## Data
--------
Preprocessed data was collected from a [Dropbox](https://www.dropbox.com/sh/y4drtqi82vwl8vf/AAAsLcrye8jUTm1XPv7VNYhFa?dl=0) 
provided by the Reik lab. Data pre-procesisng (e.g., droplet removal, batch effects) is outlined in the [manuscript](https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2022.06.15.496239v1.full). 
* For scRNA-seq, the seurat object was collected
* For scATAC-seq, the ArchR files were collected. This was subsequently processed using code outlined in the TiltedCCA github located [here](https://github.com/linnykos/tiltedCCA_analysis/blob/master/main/reik_preprocess.R)
